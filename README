unShort

Link "unshortening" integration into Windows (Linux to be worked on as needed)
   written in C#, on the .NET framework.

***********************************************************

Of course, the developer realizes this has been done before, and done well. This
   is primarily an exercise in learning certain aspects of .NET programming in the
   C# language. However, there are portions of this that are potentially useful
   and/or contain elements some users may want not offered by other link
   "unshorteners".
